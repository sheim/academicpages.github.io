**Abstract:** Despite   impressive   results   using   reinforcement learning  to  solve  complex  problems  from  scratch,  in  robotics this has still been largely limited to model-based learning with very informative reward functions. One of the major challenges is  that  the  reward  landscape  often  has  large  patches  with  no gradient, making it difficult to sample gradients effectively. We show  here  that  the  robot  state-initialization  can  have  a  more important  effect  on  the  reward  landscape  than  is  generally expected.  In  particular,  we  show  the  counter-intuitive  benefit of  including  initializations  that  are _unviable_,  in  other  words, initializing  in  states  that  are  doomed  to  fail.
