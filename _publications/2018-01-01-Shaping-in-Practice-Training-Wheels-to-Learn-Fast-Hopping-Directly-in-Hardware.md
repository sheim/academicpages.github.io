**Abstract:** Learning  instead  of  designing  robot  controllers can  greatly  reduce  engineering  effort  required,  while  also  emphasizing  robustness.  Despite  considerable  progress  in  simulation, applying learning directly in hardware is still challenging,in  part  due  to  the  necessity  to  explore  potentially  unstable parameters.  We  explore  the  concept  of  shaping  the  reward landscape with training wheels; temporary modifications of the physical hardware that facilitate learning. We demonstrate the concept  with  a  robot  leg  mounted  on  a  boom  learning  to  hop fast. This proof of concept embodies typical challenges such as instability and contact, while being simple enough to empirically map  out  and  visualize  the  reward  landscape.  Based  on  our results we propose three criteria for designing effective training wheels for learning in robotics.
